      - title: Continuous Delivery
        content: >-
          TestFairy works with any CI, including Jenkins, TeamCity, CircleCI,
          TravisCI, Bamboo, and Github Actions. The minute your app is ready, it
          will automatically upload to TEstFairy and distributed to users
          according to your API configuration.
      - title: Landing Pages
        content: >-
          Every app that is uploaded to TestFairy gets a [landing
          page](https://docs.testfairy.com/App_Distribution/Landing_Pages.html)
          that is generated automatically. This page is fully customizable, and
          allows flexible security rules, anything between open beta that anyone
          can access, to closed groups, based on permission and Single Sign-On
          credentials.
      - title: Security Permissions
        content: >-
          TestFairy includes powerful yet easy to configure security rules, that
          can either be downloaded from OKTA, or configured manually in the
          testers page. Admins can easily choose that app A is available for one
          team while app B is available to another team and app C is available
          to anyone.
      - title: Internal App Store
        content: >-
          TestFairy helps developers to manage their apps in an easy to navigate
          web or mobile interface that allows anyone with the right permissions
          to download and install their apps. Any version that was ever uploaded
          can be easily found by name, version, tags, or be marked as a
          favorite.
      - title: Email Notifications
        content: >-
          TNotifying users about new versions is important. TestFairy allows you
          to customize all email templates to make them look and feel the way
          you want. Users can be notified automatically on new versions, with
          messages sent from your email account, from your email address.
      - title: Auto Update
        content: >-
          TestFairy allows you to easily [auto
          update](https://docs.testfairy.com/App_Distribution/Auto_Update.html)
          your users to the new version that was just released. When a new
          version is available users can see a notification on screen suggesting
          to auto update. Once confirming, they will be updated to the latest
          version. Auto Update can be configured via API.
      - title: Tags
        content: >-
          Every TestFairy version can include
          [Tags](https://docs.testfairy.com/App_Distribution/Tags.html) that
          will propagate through the platform and show up next to the app in
          every screen on the dashboard, in landing pages, in emails and in bug
          reports. Tags can be set programmatically via the Upload API or
          manually in the dashboard.
      - title: Favorites
        content: >-
          In case where your dashboard includes a lot of apps, you can easily
          mark some of them as your fairies and choose to disable only your
          favorite apps, or just have them float at the top of the list. Finding
          the right app has never been easier.
